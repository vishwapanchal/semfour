# **App Name**: Network Navigator

## Core Features:

- Network Topology Designer: Canvas for users to create nodes and edges. Ability to drag/drop to position nodes. Ability to edit properties via sidebar or modal forms
- Performance Metrics Visualization: Display charts for Energy usage, Latency, Packet delivery ratio, and Network lifetime
- Predefined Example Scenarios: Load each example network into the canvas with nodes, parameters, and initial paths ready to simulate, using a dropdown.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#1A237E) for a professional and technical feel.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#EEEEEE) for backgrounds and subtle contrasts.
- Accent: Teal (#00BCD4) for highlighting key elements and interactive components.
- Use a clear, modular layout with a sidebar for node and edge properties, and a main canvas for the network topology.
- Use simple, modern icons to represent nodes, edges, and various parameters (battery, queue size, etc.).
